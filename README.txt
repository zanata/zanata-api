This repository describes the REST API presented by a Zanata server.

It also provides Data Transfer Objects(DTO) that can be used by client applications to interact with a Zanata server.

### REST API Documentation

Documentation for this API can be generated by running

`mvn enunciate:docs` on the `zanata-common-api` module

_(Please note this has to run with JDK 1.7 at the moment)_

Once generated, you can find the documentation at `zanata-common-api/target/enunciate/build/docs/rest-api-docs/index.html`
